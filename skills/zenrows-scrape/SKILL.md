description: Retrieve the content of one specific web page. Use when the user wants to read, fetch, summarize, or get what a single URL says, including JavaScript-heavy pages. Not for discovering the URLs on a site (use zenrows-map or zenrows-crawl), not for five or more URLs the user already has (use zenrows-batch), not for pulling specific fields like prices or emails (use zenrows-extract), and not for pages that require clicks, logins, or form input (use zenrows-browser).

# Scrape webpage

## Instructions

1. Identify the target URL from the user's message.
2. Call `scrape(url, mode='auto', response_type='markdown')`. Do not read local plugin or MCP config files first.
3. `mode='auto'` adds JavaScript rendering or premium proxies only when the page needs them, so the same call works for static pages and single-page apps. You do not set `js_render` or `premium_proxy` yourself.
4. Summarize or extract the requested information from the returned markdown.
5. If the content is larger than needed, re-scrape with `css_extractor` targeting only the relevant section. Drop `response_type='markdown'` when you do, since the two are alternatives, not additive.
6. For geo-restricted pages, add `proxy_country` with the target country's ISO 3166 code.
